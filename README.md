# MajorTom - NASA Space Apps Challenge 

[MajorTom](http://majortom.outdated.at) is an app prototype from [The Phoenix Foundation](https://github.com/The-Phoenix-Foundation) that was developed during the NASA Space Apps Challenge 2019 in Vienna. The app tackles the [set your sights high challenge](https://2019.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/living-our-world/set-your-sights-high/details) by an gamified AR approach and focuses predominantly on a younger userbase. Satellites approaching the user in 1000 km radius are visualized via [NASA's WorldWind library](https://worldwind.arc.nasa.gov/). These satellites can be selected while the app will display fun facts and other fascinating information. Satellites within range can be collected similarly to Pok√©mon. Collecting and learning more about satellites will unlock different badges and rewards.

### Additional features we envision in the future:
- Quizzes that test your obtained satellite knowledge and give different rewards
- International leaderboards focusing on collected satellites and widest knowledge
- The ability to invite and compete against your friends
- Trading in rewards for different satellite parts which can be used to construct your own satellites in a sandbox mode. 

## Functionality overview
Satellite trajectories are rendered color coded lines.

The satellites are rendered as 3D models that can be collected by clicking on them.

Clicking on the satellites will open an additional menu displaying additional data.
